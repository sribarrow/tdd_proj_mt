# TDD project Package

We did one of the Katas called mumble_letter. As this is TDD, we ensured passing one char failed first. The whole concept is thus,
1. Pass a string
2. Based on the index of the char in the string multiply it
3. Title case each first char in the multiplied string
4. Return each character string separated by hyphen.
